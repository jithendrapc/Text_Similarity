# Text Similarity

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Dataset: The data contains a pair of paragraphs. These text paragraphs are
randomly sampled from a raw dataset. Each pair of sentences may or may not be semantically
similar. The objective is to predict a value between 0-1 indicating the similarity between the pair of
text paras. A sample of a similar dataset will be used as test data, therefore itâ€™s crucial to the model
solution using provided dataset.

Workflow

Building an algorithm/model that can quantify the degree of similarity between the two text-based on
Semantic similarity. Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) assesses the degree to which two sentences
are semantically equivalent to each other.
1 means highly similar
0 means highly dissimilar
